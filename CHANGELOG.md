# Changelog

All notable changes to vgl are documented in this file. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Before version 1.0, minor versions may contain
breaking changes; they are listed here under **Breaking**.

The pack format has its own version number, independent of the library version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository setup: license, README, contribution guidelines, issue templates, clang-format and
  clang-tidy configuration, CMake build skeleton, and GitHub Actions CI for Windows and Linux.
- C API conventions specification (`docs/c-api.md`).
- Pack format specification, format version 1.0 (`docs/pack-format.md`), including geoid packs
  (layer type 3, section 6.4).
- `CMakePresets.json` with configure, build, test and workflow presets for the CI platforms
  (MSVC, and GCC and Clang with Ninja Multi-Config). CI builds through these presets.
- `vgl/base.h`: export and deprecation macros, `vgl_bool`, double-precision vector and matrix
  types, the `vgl_result` codes, `vgl_result_name_get` and `vgl_version_get`.
- C++ wrapper basics: `vgl::result`, `vgl::expected`, `vgl::init` and `vgl::version_get`.
- Foundation module: `vgl/foundation.h` with the allocator interface (`vgl_allocator_interface`)
  and log callback types, the `vgl::allocator` C++ adapter, and internal allocator, logger and
  double-precision math.
- Geodesy module: `vgl/geodesy.h` with `vgl_ellipsoid` and `vgl_geodetic`, WGS84, closed-form
  conversions between geodetic and ECEF coordinates, and local ENU frames, tested against
  GeographicLib 2.3 reference values. Internally, conservative bounding boxes and spheres for
  geographic regions.
- Tiling module: the geographic tiling scheme of the pack format (addresses, keys, bounds,
  sample and pixel placement, shard lookup, bilinear interpolation within a tile), internal to
  the library.
- Test harness without dependencies (`tests/harness`), and unit tests for the modules.
- Dependency handling (`cmake/vgl_dependencies.cmake`): Zstandard is used from an installed
  package, or downloaded (1.5.7, hash-checked) and compiled into vgl with hidden symbols.
- Pack format readers (`src/providers`): manifest, shard header, directory and tile parsing with
  the validation of the specification's section 8, and decoding of elevation and geoid tiles.
  Zstandard decompression routes every allocation through the vgl allocator.
- Pack format writers (`tools/baker/pack_writer`), and tests for round trips, determinism,
  versioning and corruption: every single-byte change and truncation is detected.
- Baking tool `vgl-bake` (`tools/baker`), with GDAL: `bake` (deterministic, parallel by shard,
  resumable, with a preview mode), `inspect`, `validate` (seams, poles, child masks and bounds),
  `query` and `sample-tile`. Example configurations for the M1 test bake, a conda-forge
  environment for Windows, and baker presets and CI jobs for Linux and Windows.
- Baker tests on synthetic surfaces: heights, seams, datum conversion, determinism and resuming.
- Test bake report (`docs/test-bake.md`): sizes and bake times for GLO-30 over Norway, GEBCO
  and the geoid, and the decisions on tile size (129), deepest levels (12 for GLO-30, 8 for
  GEBCO) and shard level (`max_level` - 5).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the C++ wrapper for `vgl/base.h` moved from `vgl/vgl.hpp` to `vgl/base.hpp`.
  `vgl/vgl.hpp` now includes every core wrapper header.
- The allocator interface entry `free` in the C API conventions is now `deallocate`.
- The core modules build into an object library, `vgl_objects`, from which `vgl` is made.
- On Linux, `vgl` links the math library, and a static `vgl` also the C++ runtime, so C hosts
  can link it with the C linker.
- Pack format: writers quantize on the level's global grid of steps (section 6.2), so that ties
  round the same way in every tile, and the default height steps are 0.25 m up to level 9.
- The baker's default shard level is `max_level` - 5, instead of 6.
